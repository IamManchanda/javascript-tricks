Important: These below items are not added from the above tutorial.

1. Shallow copy/clone because I have already done this and in a deeper way. See [Deep Copy with Recursion - ES6 Spread](https://codepen.io/IamManchanda/pen/XYpVPY?editors=0012)
1. Range of numbers into an array because I have already done this [here](https://github.com/IamManchanda/algorithms-javascript/blob/master/005-fizzbuzz/index.js#L11-L32).
1. Strings Section as it's completely what array(iteratable) does. Yes you need to do split but that's the whole point. Nothing new of sort! Also I have already done `capitialize` [here](https://github.com/IamManchanda/algorithms-javascript/tree/master/008-capitalize).
